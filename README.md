## Workflow Setup
### Node

-   #### Node installation on Windows

    Just go on [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and download the installer.
    Also, be sure to have `git` available in your PATH, `npm` might need it (You can find git [here](https://git-scm.com/)).

-   #### Node installation on Ubuntu

    You can install nodejs and npm easily with apt install, just run the following commands.

        $ sudo apt install nodejs
        $ sudo apt install npm

-   #### Other Operating Systems
    You can find more information about the installation on the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and the [official NPM website](https://npmjs.org/).

If the installation was successful, you should be able to run the following command.

    $ node --version
    v8.11.3

    $ npm --version
    6.1.0

If you need to update `npm`, you can make it using `npm`! Cool right? After running the following command, just open again the command line and be happy.

    $ npm install npm -g

## See SocialSpit in action

Firstly, we need to install all the dependencies in the backend and frontend folders

**For Frontend**   
```
cd frontend
yarn
```   
**For Backend**   
```
cd backend
yarn
```    
> Since npm gives some errors in this project, I recommend using yarn as the package manager.

Secondly, we need add `.env` file in `backend` folder in below format
```
MONGO_URI="<Your_MongoDB_URI>"
FRONTEND_ORIGIN="http://localhost:3000"
JWT_TOKEN="<your_jwt_token>"
```
Thirdly, run in local environment

**For Frontend**   
```
yarn start
```   
**For Backend**   
```
yarn start
``` 
Runs the app in the development mode.\
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.   
- Backend running at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to test Login and Register API.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
